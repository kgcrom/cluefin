# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for refactoring the KRX module in `packages/cluefin-openapi/krx` to eliminate code duplication using Python's `functools.partial`. The current implementation contains significant duplication across multiple modules (_stock.py, _bond.py, _index.py, _derivatives.py, etc.) where similar patterns are repeated for API endpoint handling, parameter processing, HTTP requests, and response validation.

**Status**: The core factory infrastructure (`_factory.py`) has been implemented. This refactoring task focuses on integrating the existing `KrxApiMethodFactory` into all KRX modules to eliminate code duplication while preserving 100% backward compatibility.

The refactoring aims to improve code maintainability, reduce duplication, and establish reusable patterns while preserving all existing functionality and Korean financial API specifics.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Code Duplication Elimination
**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the KRX module, I want to eliminate code duplication across API endpoint methods so that maintenance becomes easier and the codebase follows the DRY principle.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN analyzing method patterns across KRX modules THEN the system SHALL identify common patterns including parameter processing, URL path formatting, HTTP client calls, and response validation
2. WHEN implementing functools.partial refactoring THEN the system SHALL reduce code duplication by at least 70% in identified patterns
3. WHEN refactoring methods THEN the system SHALL maintain identical functionality and API signatures
4. WHEN duplicate patterns are eliminated THEN the system SHALL provide reusable function templates using functools.partial

### Requirement 2: Integration of Existing Factory Pattern
**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate the existing `KrxApiMethodFactory` into all KRX modules so that the implemented factory pattern eliminates code duplication without changing any external interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN integrating the factory THEN the system SHALL use the existing `KrxApiMethodFactory.create_single_param_method()` for all single-parameter methods
2. WHEN refactoring modules THEN the system SHALL replace duplicated method implementations with factory-generated methods
3. WHEN using the factory THEN the system SHALL preserve all original method signatures and return types exactly
4. WHEN implementing factory integration THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing Pydantic model validation
5. WHEN creating factory methods THEN the system SHALL ensure Korean field aliases and API specifics are preserved

### Requirement 3: Type Safety Preservation
**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain full type safety during refactoring so that mypy compatibility and IDE support remain intact.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN refactoring with functools.partial THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing type hints and generic type parameters
2. WHEN creating partial functions THEN the system SHALL ensure mypy can still infer return types correctly
3. WHEN implementing abstractions THEN the system SHALL preserve KrxHttpResponse[T] generic typing
4. WHEN refactoring methods THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing type checking tools

### Requirement 4: Backward Compatibility Maintenance
**User Story:** As a consumer of the KRX API client, I want all existing method signatures and behaviors to remain unchanged so that my existing code continues to work without modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN refactoring internal implementations THEN the system SHALL preserve all public method signatures exactly
2. WHEN updating method implementations THEN the system SHALL maintain identical return types and error handling
3. WHEN applying functools.partial patterns THEN the system SHALL ensure no breaking changes to public APIs
4. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN the system SHALL pass all existing unit and integration tests without modification

### Requirement 5: Korean Financial API Specifics Preservation
**User Story:** As a user of Korean financial data, I want all Korean-specific API behaviors and field handling to remain intact so that the client continues to work correctly with KRX APIs.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN refactoring API methods THEN the system SHALL preserve Korean field aliases and parameter names (e.g., "basDd" for base_date)
2. WHEN implementing new patterns THEN the system SHALL maintain Korean timezone handling and date format requirements (YYYYMMDD)
3. WHEN abstracting common patterns THEN the system SHALL preserve KRX-specific error handling and authentication mechanisms
4. WHEN creating partial functions THEN the system SHALL ensure Korean stock code handling and market-specific logic remain intact

### Requirement 6: Testing and Validation Requirements
**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive testing to ensure the refactored code maintains all existing functionality so that no regressions are introduced.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN the system SHALL pass all existing unit tests without any test modifications
2. WHEN factory methods are implemented THEN the system SHALL include unit tests for the `KrxApiMethodFactory` class
3. WHEN integration tests are run THEN the system SHALL maintain identical API behavior with real KRX endpoints
4. WHEN testing edge cases THEN the system SHALL handle error conditions identically to the original implementation

### Requirement 7: Refactoring-Only Constraint
**User Story:** As a project stakeholder, I want this task to focus solely on internal code improvements without adding any new features so that the scope remains controlled and risk is minimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN refactoring modules THEN the system SHALL NOT add any new public methods or change existing method signatures
2. WHEN integrating the factory THEN the system SHALL NOT modify any external APIs or response formats
3. WHEN completing the refactoring THEN the system SHALL maintain identical behavior from a user's perspective
4. WHEN updating code THEN the system SHALL focus only on eliminating duplication using the existing factory infrastructure
