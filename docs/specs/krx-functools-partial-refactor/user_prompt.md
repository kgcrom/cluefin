I want to refacor code in packages/cluefin-openapi/krx.                  
When a parameter is received from a user, it is well processed and requested with an appropriate path,
and model-validated with the response defined for each method.                       

I'm trying to refactor duplicate code using functools.partial in the Python basic package. 
Please write the requirements, design, and what to do step by step to ./docs/specs/{spec-name}.
